# WordleClone

A recreation of the word guessing game Wordle. Written with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Deployed on GitHub Pages at: [nnorx.github.io/WordleClone/](https://nnorx.github.io/WordleClone/).

# What I Learned

* Using JavaScript to access DOM elements directly, and managing state in this way.
* Animating elements with CSS (shake and dance) and transitioning elements with CSS (flipping tiles).
* Enabling/disabling event listeners to control the user's interaction with the page.
* Converting user input to changes in state of game.
